CSC 365 Lab 6

The name of the database that I created the lab6-specific INN tables
was jolive06. 

I did this lab solo.

I ran these commands in the terminal before running the program.

export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:mysql-connector-java-5.1.45-bin.jar:.
export HP_JDBC_URL=jdbc:mysql://csc365winter2018.webredirect.org/jolive06>?autoReconnect=true\&useSSL=false
export HP_JDBC_USER=jolive06
export HP_JDBC_PW=365W18_011151994

To compile the program...

javac InnReservations.java


To run the program...

java InnReservations


Enter only an integer 1-5 on initial prompt.
Follow instructions exactly (i.e must enter 'N/A' or '<date> to <date>' precisely).
Enter dates as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
Adding spaces unnecessarily could prevent program from running correctly.
Program fails to find next available check-in date and length of most recent stay.
