I got the data from https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets
I used the titanic dataset.

I created one table that held all of the data that was available from the csv file.
The table contains essentially all of the information that the registry has on 
each passenger. This contains passenger id as a primary key, as well as other
info like their age, gender, fare, and whether they survived.

Mapping challenges included that some of the entries in the dataset did not contain
information for all of the attributes given. This made it a little harder to read
in the file, as well as create proper SQL insert statements. The structure of the
csv files made reading the files a lot simpler.

Is it necessary to have a unique passenger id to identify passengers? Meaning,
is it possible to idenfity unique passengers without this key?
Can a default, unique value be made to be inserted for entries with no input for
certain attributes?
Would it be more useful/more efficient to split up the data into different tables?
